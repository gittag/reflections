How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It enables to compare files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can get back on older versions to see changes or be back on a no bug version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual is subject to errors still it enables to have more insight and no useless savings

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is mainly design for developpers so since codes interacts with multiple files it's just necessary

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We have access to former commits and then move on one specific to check its version of files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You always can get back to prior to changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To be safe with my files while working on it.
