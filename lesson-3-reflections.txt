When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To have a backup version and/or when working with a team on a same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to choose what you're pulling and may not need everything.
